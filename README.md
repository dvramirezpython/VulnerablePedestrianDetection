# VulnerablePedestrianDetection
This project focuses on the development of a real-time vulnerable pedestrian detection system capable of operating reliably in both normal and adverse weather conditions. The system integrates state-of-the-art deep learning object detection models, specifically YOLO (You Only Look Once) and RT-DETR (Real-Time DEtection TRansformer).
